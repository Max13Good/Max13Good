## Demo Student Dashboard

This repository contains a simple Django project used to demonstrate a student's personal account page.  
**The interface features a sidebar menu, top navigation bar and responsive layout built with TailwindCSS and interactive elements powered by Alpine.js.**

All demo data is stored directly in the Django view, so a database is not required.

### Quick start

```bash
pip install django==4.2
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/student/` in your browser.
